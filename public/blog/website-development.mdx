<h4 className='font-bold'>Introduction</h4>

Stickbot.net's history begins with Stickbot, the multipurpose "for-fun"
Discord bot I started working on in October 2022 (although I'm sure I
had other versions of it going back even earlier). The main thing Stickbot is
known for is its Steam account "tagging" and community server ban lookup
features. 

Although I had always wanted to make my own website, it wasn't until I took
a university class on Fullstack Javascript that I finally had the means to put
something out there. Why a Stickbot-centered website first? Really, it was
because other domains I wanted were taken (good luck ever getting mahmoud.com
or stick.net...) and because Stickbot's database was hosted on
<a href="https://mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>, which made it exceptionally easy to
build an interface around. Soon enough, I had a robust Steam profile lookup
page, login system, and API.

With the bulk of Stickbot's features implemented, I had run out of things to
add to the website. I added random utilities that, although gave me something
to code, weren't really of much usefulness to people. Hence why the old website
had a URL shortener, Soundcloud downloader, and QR code generator.
